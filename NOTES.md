## TODO
- Implement update formula for the variance and test
- Implement EM using SVD formula
- Implement Gradient descent?
- Is stochastic gradient descent applicable here? Look at the problem formulation


- Initialization: which initialization method is the best
- 

## What to explore
- Theory behind EM, MAP and Variational Bayes
- Code
- Comparisons of these algorithms on 5 different data sets
given by movie lens + a few more data sets on different
set of data, with different ranks too 
- 

What I need to do
- More data sets
- Initialization for MAP
- Test different rankings
- Test RSME/iteration for all methods
-
